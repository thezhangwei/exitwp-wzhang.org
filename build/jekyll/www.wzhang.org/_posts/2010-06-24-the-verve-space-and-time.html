<strong>[Space and Time - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>There ain't no space and time<br>
To keep our love alive<br>
We have existence and it's all we share<br>
There ain't no real truth<br>
There ain't no real lies<br>
Keep on pushin' 'cause I know it's there<br>
<br>
Oh, can you just tell me<br>
It's all right (It's all right)<br>
Let me sleep tonight<br>
Oh, can you comfort me<br>
Tonight (It's all right)<br>
Make it all seem fine<br>
<br>
I just can't make it alone<br>
Oh, no, no<br>
I just can't make it alone<br>
Oh, no, no<br>
There'll be no lullabies<br>
There'll be no tears cried<br>
We feel numb 'cause we don't see<br>
That if we really care<br>
And we really loved<br>
Think of all the joy we'd feel<br>
<br>
Oh, can you just tell me<br>
It's all right (It's all right)<br>
Let me sleep tonight<br>
Oh, can you comfort me<br>
Tonight (It's all right)<br>
Make it all seem fine<br>
<br>
I just can't make it alone<br>
Oh, no, no<br>
I just can't make it alone<br>
Oh, no, no<br>
I just can't make it alone<br>
Oh, no, no<br>
I just can't make it alone<br>
Oh, no, no<br>
<br>
Ain't got no lullaby, no, no<br>
Ain't got no lullaby, oh, no<br>
There is no space and time<br>
Oh lord<br>
There is no space and time<br>
Oh lord<br>
<br>
We have existence and it's all we share<br>
We have existence and it's all we share<br>
We have existence and it's all we share<br>
We have existence and it's all we share<br>
We have existence and it's all we share<br>
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there<br>
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there<br>
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there<br>
Keep on pushing 'cause I know it's there</em>
