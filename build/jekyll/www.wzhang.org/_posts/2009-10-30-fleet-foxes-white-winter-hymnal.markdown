[White Winter Hymnal - Lyric]
I was following the pack
All swallowed in their coats 
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads
From fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round, and there you go
And Michael you would fall
And turn the white snow red as strawberries
In the summertime...
