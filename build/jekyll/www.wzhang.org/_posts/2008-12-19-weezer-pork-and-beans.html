[Pork and Beans - Lyrics]<br><br>
They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair<br>
Work it out at the gym to fit my underwear<br>
Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool<br>
You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool<br>
<br>
I'mma do the things that I wanna do<br>
I ain't got a thing to prove to you<br>
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans<br>
Excuse my manners if I make a scene<br>
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like<br>
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside<br>
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink<br>
I don't give a hoot about what you think<br>
<br>
Everyone likes to dance to a happy song (Hey, hey)<br>
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along (Hey, hey)<br>
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart<br>
Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art<br>
<br>
I'mma do the things that I wanna do<br>
I ain't got a thing to prove to you<br>
(Ain't got a thing to prove to you)<br>
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans<br>
Excuse my manners if I make a scene<br>
(Excuse my manners if I ahhhhhh.....)<br>
<br>
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like<br>
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside<br>
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink<br>
I don't give a hoot about what you think<br>
<br>
No I don't care, I don't care<br>
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care<br>
<br>
I'mma do the things that I wanna do<br>
I ain't got a thing to prove to you<br>
(Ain't got a thing to prove to you)<br>
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans<br>
Excuse my manners if I make a scene<br>
(Excuse my manners if I ahhhhhh.....)<br>
<br>
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like<br>
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside<br>
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink<br>
I don't give a hoot about what you think<br>
<br>
(Everyone likes to dance, to dance, to dance, to dance........)<br>
