[Seether - Gasoline](http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=5122414)  


[Gasoline - lyric]
Last night I saw that beauty queen
Watched her paint her face on
I wanna be that magazine
That she bases life on
I wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love
Wanna get some gasoline
And burn the house down

She’s got nothing to say
She’s got bills to pay
She’s got no one to hate
Except for me

Last night I saw that beauty queen
She's getting high on Revlon
I wanna be that magazine
That she wastes her life on
I wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love
Wanna get some gasoline
And burn the house down

She’s got nothing to say
She’s got bills to pay
She’s got no one to hate
Except for me
Me.

When I saw that beauty queen
watched her paint her face on
I wanna be the one unclean
that she wipes her ass on
wanna waste her monthly blood
wanna get some on my love
wanna get some gasoline
And burn the house down

She’s got nothing to say
She’s got bills to pay
She’s got no one to hate
Except for me
Me.

She's got nothing but shame
She takes pills for pain
She's got no one to blame
Except for me
Me.
