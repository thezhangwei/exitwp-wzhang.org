[Somersault - Lyric]<br><br>
You're the prince to my ballerina<br>
You feed other people's parking meters<br>
You encourage the eating of ice cream<br>
You would somersault in sand with me<br>
You talk to loners, you ask how's your week<br>
You give love to all and give love to me<br>
You're obsessed with hiding the sticks and stones<br>
When I feel the unknown<br>
You feel like home, you feel like home<br>
<br>
You put my feet back on the ground<br>
Did you know you brought me around<br>
You were sweet, and you were sound<br>
You saved me<br>
<br>
You're the warmth in my summer breeze<br>
You're the ivory to my ebony keys<br>
You would share your last jelly bean<br>
You would somersault in sand with me<br>
<br>
You put my feet back on the ground<br>
Did you know you brought me around<br>
You were sweet and you were sound<br>
You saved me<br>
<br>
You put my feet back on the ground<br>
Did you know you brought me around<br>
You were sweet and you were sound<br>
See I had shrunk yet still you wore me around<br>
And 'round and 'round<br>
