**[Fractured (Everything I said Was True) - Lyric]**
_Your story only tells one side, 
It's based on fact, but filled with lies 
(you'd be rich if each was worth a dime) 
I played my part and that's defined 
You played the field on borrowed time 

(and I know that fault was all but mine) 

I chose to let you in 
You chose to pull away 
I jumped right out of my skin 
When I heard you say 

Everything I said was true 
Everything except that I love you 
If anekatips it's not me, than who? 
I think I deserve to know 
Now we're through and through 

No glory resides inside my mind 
At least I never crossed the line 
(cause I don't need the distraction) 
But an angel appeared on your devil's side 
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide 
(I'm just a nickel with traction) 

So should we say goodnight 
And give it one more try? 
This isn't worth the fight 
So let's just say goodbye 

Everything I said was true 
Everything except I love you too 
and if it's not me, it's you! 
I thought you deserved to know 
now we're through and through 

Sad to see forethought after me cause 
that's not fair 
Put yourself in my shoes and become 
The fractured one cause 
I no longer care! 

Everything I said was true 
Everything except that I love you 
and if it's not me, fuck you! 
I thought you deserved to know 
Now I'm through with you 

And if it's not me, it's you! 
And if it's not me, it's you!_
