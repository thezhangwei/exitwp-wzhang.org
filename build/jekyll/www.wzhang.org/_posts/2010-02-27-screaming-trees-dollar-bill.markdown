**[Dollar Bill - Lyric]**

Torn like an old dollar bill
Girl let them say what they will
That no one should hurt you
And that's all I seem to do
That no one should desert you
And that's all I seem to do

I got to tell you, goodbye mama
We've taken this too far
Been trying to tell you what's going on
Trying to make it easy on you
Trying to make it better
Make it easier on you
It's all I came to do
It's all I came to do

Now I'm down in the light
And I must be dreaming it
Cause I see clearly, I see angels here
Bringing something to me, Mother Mercy

I told a lie, I didn't mean it
Goodbye mama, I've taken this too far
Been gone a while
Been gone a long way, oh yeah

I don't want to hurt you
It's all I seem to do
Don't want to desert you
It's all I seem to do

I got to tell you, goodbye mama
I've taken this too far
Been down a while
Been down a long way

Trying to make it easy on you
Trying to make it better
Make it easier on you
It's all I came to do
It's all I came to do
It's all I came to do
That's all... been down a long
Been down a long, long way
Torn like an old dollar bill
