[Be Yourself - Lyric]<br><br>
Someone falls to pieces<br>
Sleepin all alone<br>
Someone kills the pain<br>
Spinning in the silence<br>
To finally drift away<br>
Someone gets excited<br>
In a chapel yard<br>
Catches a bouquet<br>
Another lays a dozen<br>
White roses on a grave<br>
<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
Someone finds salvation in everyone<br>
And another only pain<br>
Someone tries to hide himself<br>
Down inside himself he prays<br>
Someone swears his true love<br>
Untill the end of time<br>
Another runs away<br>
Separate or united?<br>
Healthy or insane?<br>
<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
<br>
And even when you've paid enough, been pulled apart or been held up<br>
With every single memory of the good or bad faces of luck<br>
don't lose any sleep tonight<br>
I'm sure everything will end up alright<br>
<br>
You may win or lose<br>
<br>
But to be yourself is all that you can do<br>
To be yourself is all that you can do<br>
