[You're All That I Have - Lyric]<br><br>
Strain this chaos turn it into light<br>
I've got to see you one last night<br>
Before the lions take their share<br>
Leave us in pieces, scattered everywhere<br>
<br>
Just give me a chance to hold on<br>
Just give me a chance to hold on<br>
Just give me a chance to hold on<br>
Just give me something to hold onto<br>
<br>
It's so clear now that you are all that I have<br>
I have no fear cause you are all that I have<br>
It's so clear now that you are all that I have<br>
I have no fear cause you are all that I have<br>
You're cinematic, razor sharp<br>
A welcome arrow through the heart<br>
Under your skin feels like home<br>
Electric shocks on aching bones<br>
<br>
Give me a chance to hold on<br>
Give me a chance to hold on<br>
Give me a chance to hold on<br>
Just give me something to hold onto<br>
<br>
It's so clear now that you are all that I have<br>
I have no fear cause you are all that I have<br>
It's so clear now that you are all that I have<br>
I have no fear cause you are all that I have<br>
<br>
There is a darkness deep in you<br>
A frightening magic I cling to<br>
<br>
Give me a chance to hold on<br>
Give me a chance to hold on<br>
Give me a chance to hold on<br>
Just give me something to hold onto<br>
<br>
It's so clear now that you are all that I have<br>
I have no fear now you are all that I have<br>
It's so clear now that you are all that I have<br>
I have no fear now you are all that I have<br>
