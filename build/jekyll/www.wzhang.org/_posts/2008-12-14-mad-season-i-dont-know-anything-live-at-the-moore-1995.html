[I Don't Know Anything － Lyric]<br><br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know who I am<br>
<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know who I am<br>
<br>
Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? Oh yeah<br>
Why the fighting and the coming down, am I sane?<br>
I don't know, yeah<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know who to be<br>
<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know who I am<br>
<br>
Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? Oh yeah<br>
Why the fighting and the coming down, am I sane?<br>
I don't know<br>
When the teacher put the ruler down on my hand<br>
I laugh!<br>
Cross my heart and hide reliever in trails of blood,<br>
I love?!?<br>
<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know who I am<br>
<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know anything<br>
I don't know who to be<br>
<br>
Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? Oh yeah<br>
Why the fighting and the coming down, am I sane?<br>
I don't know<br>
When the teacher put the ruler down on my hand<br>
I laugh!<br>
Cross my heart and hide reliever in trails of blood,<br>
I love?!? <br>
