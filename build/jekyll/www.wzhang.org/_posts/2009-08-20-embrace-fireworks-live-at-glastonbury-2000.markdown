**I Don't Need Convincing...**
[Fireworks - Lyric]
I stretched over to reach you
I tried to meet you
I've been wrong
Now the fireworks in me are all gone
It's time you realized

My girl you make all the smart moves
and you see through all my wrongs
When the fireworks in me are all wrong
Well then I realized

And I dont need convincing 
I've seen enough to want to try and change things
You fell in love I fell in line
I thought I'd found my place
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
Have I let you-I'll never let you down

I work all day and I wanna fight
when it feels right and it's wrong
When the fireworks in me are all gone
Well then I realized

And I wont need convincing
I've seen enough to want to try and change things
You fell in love I fell in line
I thought I'd found my place
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
Could I leave you? I'll never let you down
