<p>If you know what I mean...</p>
[Wishlist - Lyric]<br><br>
I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off<br>
I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on<br>
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on<br>
The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top<br>
I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds<br>
For 50 million hands upraised and open toward the sky<br>
<br>
I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me<br>
I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me<br>
I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good<br>
I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood<br>
<br>
I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun<br>
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on<br>
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on<br>
I wish I was the verb 'to trust' and never let you down<br>
<br>
I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up<br>
I wish...<br>
I wish...<br>
