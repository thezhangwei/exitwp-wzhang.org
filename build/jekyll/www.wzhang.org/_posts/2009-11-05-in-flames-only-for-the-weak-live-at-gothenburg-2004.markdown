[Only For The Weak - Lyric]
I can't tolerate your sadness
Cause it's me you are drowning (You're drowning me)
I won't allow (allow) any happiness
Cause everytime you laugh, I feel so (so weak)... guilty (guilty)
I feel so guilty

Am I forced to have any regret
I've become the lie, beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me

Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
Cause it's me you're draining (You're draining me)
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark tale
Cause everytime you run, I fall (fall).. behind (behind)
I fall behind

And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man there I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie

Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me

Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
On bleeding knees, oh, I accept my fate

[instrumental part]

Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me

Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
On bleeding knees, oh, I accept my fate

Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me

Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak
On bleeding knees...
