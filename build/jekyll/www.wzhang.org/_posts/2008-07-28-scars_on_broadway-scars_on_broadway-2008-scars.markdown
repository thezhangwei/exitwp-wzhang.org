I know it's a little bit late but Now I really start to listen to this again and again. So I hope it could blow you away maybe just for a minute.

**S.O.B.-They Say**


[_[They Say - lyric from LyricWiki]_](http://lyricwiki.org/Scars_On_Broadway:They_Say)
**S.O.B.-Insane**

[Scars on Broadway - Insane - lyric]
So many ways to hide
I see the trouble deep inside

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Run, run baby run
You'll see the things to overcome

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Dream, dream your broken dream
You'll see the things I never see

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
