[Crawl - Lyric][[MP3](http://hypeful.com/wp-admin/mp3s/01%20Crawl.mp3)]
You fault my pride
Don’t ever need to 'pologize
As your lips unfold
Shaken purple from the cold

You better learn to crawl
You better learn to crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

You broke my mouth
The bloody bits are spitting out
Is your grave unscathed
The worm is counting down the days

He wants to see you crawl
He wants to see you crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way

As the rat, and the fly
They’re searching for an alibi
As we await the wrath
They never went to Sunday Mass

They want to see us crawl
They want to see us crawl
Before they walk away
Before they walk away

The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way
