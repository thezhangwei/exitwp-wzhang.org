[Your decision - Lyric]<br><br>
Time to change has come and gone<br>
Watched your fears become your God<br>
<br>
It's your decision<br>
It's your decision<br>
<br>
Overwhelmed, you chose to run<br>
Apathetic to the stunned<br>
<br>
It's your decision<br>
It's your decision<br>
You feed the fire that burned us all<br>
When you lied<br>
To feel the pain that spurs you on<br>
Black inside<br>
<br>
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower<br>
And here you stand before us all and say it's over<br>
It's over<br>
<br>
(solo)<br>
<br>
It might seem an afterthought<br>
Yes it hurts to know you're bought<br>
<br>
It's your decision<br>
It's your decision<br>
<br>
You feed the fire that burned us all<br>
When you lied<br>
To feel the pain that spurs you on<br>
Black inside<br>
<br>
It's your decision<br>
It's your decision<br>
<br>
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower<br>
And here you stand before us all and say it's over<br>
It's over<br>
<br>
It's over<br>
