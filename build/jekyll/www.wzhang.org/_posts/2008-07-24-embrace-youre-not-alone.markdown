[You're not alone - Lyric]
No, you're not alone
cause everybody's out there on their own
but you were one of the scene
trying to be like no ones ever been
and everybody knows that that's the way it goes
and that's alright with me, I've got time
you try so hard you get it wrong
you can't deny the feeling's gone
it's time you got the look that you need

so keep holding on and time will come
you'll jump right up
and find you're back on top of the world
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,
come on everybody knows you're meant for better
and say what you mean, or you won't mean a thing to me
come on everybody ignores you now but soon your time will come
yeah they'll know who you are

No, you're not alone
cause everyone who's out there's on there own
but you were always the same
tryin to be like no ones ever been
you try so hard you get it wrong
you can't deny the feeling's gone
its time you took a look at what you need

so keep holding on and time will come
you'll jump right up
and find you're back on top of the world
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,
come on everybody knows you're meant for better
and say what you mean, or you won't mean a thing to me
come on everybody ignores you now but soon your time will come

you're on top of the world
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,
come on everybody knows you're meant for better
and say what you mean, or you won't mean a thing to me
come on everybody ignores you now but no it's not the end of the world
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,
come on everybody, you know you're meant for better
(you know you're meant for better)
