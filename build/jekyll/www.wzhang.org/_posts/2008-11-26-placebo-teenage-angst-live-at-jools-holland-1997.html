[Teenage Angst - Lyric]<br><br>
Shine the headlight,<br>
straight into my eyes.<br>
Like the roadkill,<br>
I'm paralysed.<br>
You see through my disguise<br>
<br>
At the drive-in,<br>
double feature,<br>
pull the lever,<br>
break the fever and say your last goodbyes.<br>
<br>
Since I was born I started to decay.<br>
Now nothing ever ever goes my way.<br>
One fluid gesture,<br>
like stepping back in time.<br>
Trapped in amber, petrified.<br>
And still not satisfied.<br>
<br>
Airs and social graces,<br>
elocution so divine.<br>
I'll stick to my needle,<br>
and my favourite waste of time,<br>
both spineless and sublime.<br>
<br>
Since I was born I started to decay.<br>
Now nothing ever - ever goes my way. <br>
