[Use Somebody - Lyric][From LyricWiki.org]<br><br>
I've been roaming around<br>
Always looking down at all I see<br>
Painted faces, build the places I cant reach<br>
<br>
You know that I could use somebody<br>
You know that I could use somebody<br>
<br>
Someone like you, And all you know, And how you speak<br>
Countless lovers under cover of the street<br>
<br>
You know that I could use somebody<br>
You know that I could use somebody<br>
Someone like you<br>
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep<br>
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat<br>
I hope it's gonna make you notice<br>
I hope it's gonna make you notice<br>
<br>
Someone like me<br>
Someone like me<br>
Someone like me, somebody<br>
<br>
Someone like you, somebody<br>
Someone like you, somebody<br>
Someone like you, somebody<br>
<br>
I've been roaming around,<br>
Always looking down at all I see <br>
