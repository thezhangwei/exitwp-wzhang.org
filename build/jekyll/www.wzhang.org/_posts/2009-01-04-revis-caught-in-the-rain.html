[Caught In The Rain - Lyric]<br><br>
Is it real<br>
We're always the same<br>
We're almost undone now<br>
I was caught in the rain<br>
Wasting my time on the ground<br>
Awaiting the call<br>
Of what would you say<br>
And can you come over<br>
I was caught in the rain<br>
Wasting my time on the ground<br>
<br>
Chorus:<br>
It was you<br>
Who could get me high<br>
With whatever you say<br>
You're telling me something real<br>
Well, what we've done<br>
It doesn't matter now<br>
Whatever it takes<br>
For you to stay with me<br>
<br>
Trading thoughts<br>
Across from the room<br>
I saw you surrounded<br>
I was caught in the rain<br>
Wasting my time on the ground<br>
Feeling us fall<br>
Without an escape<br>
I almost let you down<br>
I was caught in the rain<br>
Wasting my time on the ground<br>
<br>
Chorus (x2)<br>
<br>
I was caught in the rain,<br>
Wasting my time on the ground (x2)<br>
<br>
I was caught in the rain<br>
Caught in the rain" <br>
