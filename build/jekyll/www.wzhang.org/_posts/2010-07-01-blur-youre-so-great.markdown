没有心情听新歌，继续英伦怀旧。将就听吧...
**[You're So Great - Lyric]**
_Sad, drunk, and poorly 
Sleeping really late 
Sad, drunk, and poorly 
Not feeling so great 
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns 
Sad, drunk, and poorly 
Dogs digging up the ground 

And I feel the light 
In the night and in the day 
And I feel the light 
When the sky's just mud and grey 
And I feel the light 
When you tell me it's OK 
Cos you're so great, and I love you 

Tea Tea and coffee 
Helps to start the day 
Tea Tea and coffee 
Shaking all the way 
City's alive and, surprise, so am I 
Tea, tea and coffee 
Get no sleep today 

And I feel the light 
In the night and in the day 
And I feel the light 
When the sky's just mud and grey 
And I feel the light 
When you tell me it's OK 
Cos you're so great, and I love you_
