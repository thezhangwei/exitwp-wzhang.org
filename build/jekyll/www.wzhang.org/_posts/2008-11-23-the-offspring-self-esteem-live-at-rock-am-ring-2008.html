[Self Esteem - Lyric]<br><br>
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
<br>
I wrote her off for the tenth time today<br>
And practiced all the things I would say<br>
But she came over, I lost my nerve<br>
I took her back and made her dessert<br>
<br>
Now I know I'm being used<br>
That's okay, man, cause I like the abuse<br>
Now I know she's playing with me<br>
That's ok cause I got no self esteem<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
We make plans to go out at night<br>
I wait till two then I turn out the light<br>
This rejections got me so low<br>
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
When she's saying that she wants only me<br>
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends<br>
When she's saying that I'm like a disease<br>
Then I wonder how much more I can stand<br>
Well I guess, I should stick up for myself<br>
But I really think it's better this way<br>
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care<br>
Right?<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
Now I'll relate this a little bit<br>
That happens more than I'd like to admit<br>
Late at night she knocks on my door<br>
She's drunk again and looking to score<br>
<br>
Now I know I should say no<br>
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go<br>
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb<br>
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
Oh, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
When she's saying that she wants only me<br>
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends<br>
When she's saying that I'm like a disease<br>
Then I wonder how much more I can stand<br>
Well I guess, I should stick up for myself<br>
But I really think it's better this way<br>
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care<br>
Right?<br>
Yeah! <br>
