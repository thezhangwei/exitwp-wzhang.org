[Slide Away - Lyrics]<br><br>
So take your time<br>
I wonder if you're here just to use my mind<br>
Don't take it slow<br>
You know I've got a place to go<br>
You always do that<br>
Something I'm not sure of<br>
But just for today<br>
Let go and slide away<br>
<br>
I was thinking maybe we could go outside<br>
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride<br>
Don't you feel alive<br>
These are your times and our highs<br>
So take your time<br>
I wonder which cup you'll drink from<br>
I hope it's mine<br>
Beause you always do that something<br>
Something I'm not sure of<br>
But just for today<br>
Let go and slide away away<br>
'Cause I read your mind<br>
I need it because it takes me where I can't find<br>
Because you always do that something<br>
Something I'm not sure of<br>
But just for today<br>
Let go and burn away<br>
<br>
I was thinking maybe we could go outside<br>
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride<br>
Don't you feel alive<br>
These are your times and our highs<br>
<br>
Slide Away burn away<br>
Slide Away burn away<br>
I read your mind<br>
I read your mind<br>
'Cause it takes me to where I can't find... <br>
