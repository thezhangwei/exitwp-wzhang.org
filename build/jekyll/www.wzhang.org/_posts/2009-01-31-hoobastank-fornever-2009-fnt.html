[Lyric - Tears of Yesterday]<br><br>
I write your name in my breath on the window<br>
Sit and watch as it fades away<br>
The painful memories<br>
Of the tears of yesterday<br>
<br>
The sky is cold and gray<br>
Just like it was when we both went our separate ways<br>
And the rain won't wash away<br>
All the dirt of my mistakes<br>
So I write your name in my breath on the window<br>
Sit and watch as it fades away<br>
The painful memories<br>
Of the tears of yesterday<br>
<br>
The deafening sound of rain<br>
Its not enough to drown my thoughts to ease the pain<br>
So instead I'll soak it in<br>
While I stare outside again<br>
<br>
And I write your name in my breath on the window<br>
Sit and watch as it fades away<br>
The painful memories<br>
Of the tears of yesterday<br>
I try so hard but I can't seem to let go<br>
I lost so much when you walked away<br>
The painful memories<br>
Of the tears of yesterday<br>
<br>
The sun just won't seem to come out<br>
Not since you walked away<br>
Now I cannot escape<br>
I cannot escape the rain<br>
The rain<br>
<br>
So I write your name in my breath on the window<br>
Sit and watch as it fades away<br>
The painful memories<br>
Of the tears of yesterday<br>
I try so hard but I can't seem to let go<br>
I lost so much when you walked away<br>
The painful memories<br>
Of the tears of yesterday<br>
Yesterday<br>
Yesterday <br>
