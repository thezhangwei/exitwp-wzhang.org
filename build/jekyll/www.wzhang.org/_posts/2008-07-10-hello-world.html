[Blurry - Lyric - Click More]<br><br>
Everything's so blurry<br>
and everyone's so fake<br>
and everybody's empty<br>
and everything is so messed up<br>
pre-occupied without you<br>
I cannot live at all<br>
My whole world surrounds you<br>
I stumble then I crawl<br>
<br>
You could be my someone<br>
you could be my scene<br>
you know that i'll protect you<br>
from all of the obscene<br>
I wonder what you're doing<br>
imagine where you are<br>
there's oceans in between us<br>
but that's not very far<br>
<br>
Can you take it all away<br>
can you take it all away<br>
well ya shoved it in my face<br>
this pain you gave to me<br>
Can you take it all away<br>
can you take it all away<br>
well ya shoved it my face<br>
<br>
Everyone is changing<br>
there's noone left that's real<br>
to make up your own ending<br>
and let me know just how you feel<br>
cause I am lost without you<br>
I cannot live at all<br>
my whole world surrounds you<br>
I stumble then I crawl<br>
<br>
You could be my someone<br>
you could be my scene<br>
you know that i will save you<br>
from all of the unclean<br>
I wonder what you're doing<br>
I wonder where you are<br>
There's oceans in between us<br>
but that's not very far<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Nobody told me what you thought<br>
nobody told me what to say<br>
everyone showed you where to turn<br>
told you when to runaway<br>
nobody told you where to hide<br>
nobody told you what to say<br>
everyone showed you where to turn<br>
showed you when to runaway<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
<br>
You take it all<br>
You take it all away...<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
You take it all away<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
Take it all away<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
