[Grapevine Fire - Lyric]
When the wind picked up, the fire spread
And the grapevine seemed left for dead
And the northern sky looked like the end of days
The end of days

The wake-up call to a rented room
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom
To warn us it's only a matter of time
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn

We bought some wine and some paper cups
Near your daughter's school when we picked her up
And drove to a cemetery on a hill
On a hill

And we watched the plumes paint the sky gray
As she laughed and danced through the field of graves
There I knew it would be alright
That everything would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright

And the news reports on the radio said it was getting worse
As the ocean air fanned the flames
But I couldn't think of anywhere I would've rather been
To watch it all burn away, to burn away

Burn
Burn
Burn

The firemen worked in double shifts
With prayers for rain on their lips
And they knew it was only a matter of time
