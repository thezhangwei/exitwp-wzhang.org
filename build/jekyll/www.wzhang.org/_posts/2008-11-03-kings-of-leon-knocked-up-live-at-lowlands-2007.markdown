[Knocked Up - Lyric]
I don't care what nobody says we're gonna have a baby
Takin' off in a Coupe de Ville she's buckled up on navy

She don't care what her momma says no she's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take because taken gonna shape me

People call us renegades because we like living crazy
We like taking on the town because people are getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says no I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk, but I love her like no other

And the doctor seems to say he don't know where we're gonna go

I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know where we're gonna go

People call us renegades because we like living crazy
We like takin' on this town because people are getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says no I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk but I love her like no other

And her daddy doesn't think he quite knows where we're gonna go

I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know where we're gonna go...

Where we're gonna go...

Where we're gonna go...

Where we're gonna go...

Where we're gonna...


People call us renegades...

We like taking on this town...

I don't care what nobody says we're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville she's buckled up on navy


She don't care what her momma says no she's gonna have my baby
I'm takin' all I have to take because taken gonna shape me
