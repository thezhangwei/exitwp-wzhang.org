[You're not alone - Lyric]<br><br>
No, you're not alone<br>
cause everybody's out there on their own<br>
but you were one of the scene<br>
trying to be like no ones ever been<br>
and everybody knows that that's the way it goes<br>
and that's alright with me, I've got time<br>
you try so hard you get it wrong<br>
you can't deny the feeling's gone<br>
it's time you got the look that you need<br>
<br>
so keep holding on and time will come<br>
you'll jump right up<br>
and find you're back on top of the world<br>
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,<br>
come on everybody knows you're meant for better<br>
and say what you mean, or you won't mean a thing to me<br>
come on everybody ignores you now but soon your time will come<br>
yeah they'll know who you are<br>
No, you're not alone<br>
cause everyone who's out there's on there own<br>
but you were always the same<br>
tryin to be like no ones ever been<br>
you try so hard you get it wrong<br>
you can't deny the feeling's gone<br>
its time you took a look at what you need<br>
<br>
so keep holding on and time will come<br>
you'll jump right up<br>
and find you're back on top of the world<br>
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,<br>
come on everybody knows you're meant for better<br>
and say what you mean, or you won't mean a thing to me<br>
come on everybody ignores you now but soon your time will come<br>
<br>
you're on top of the world<br>
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,<br>
come on everybody knows you're meant for better<br>
and say what you mean, or you won't mean a thing to me<br>
come on everybody ignores you now but no it's not the end of the world<br>
sure in time you'll be heard, you said,<br>
come on everybody, you know you're meant for better<br>
(you know you're meant for better)<br>
