[I Don't Know - Lyric]<br><br>
I don't know what you smoke<br>
Or what countries you've been to<br>
If you speak any other languages other than your own<br>
I'd like to meet you<br>
<br>
I don't know if you drive<br>
If you love the ground beneath you<br>
I don't know if you write letters or you panic on the phone<br>
I'd like to call you<br>
<br>
All the same, if you want to<br>
I am game<br>
I don't know if you can swim<br>
If the sea has any draw for you<br>
If you're better in the morning or when the sun goes down<br>
I'd like to call you<br>
<br>
I don't know if you can dance<br>
If the thought ever occurred to you<br>
If you eat what you've been given or you push it 'round your plate<br>
I'd like to cook for you<br>
<br>
All the same, I would want to<br>
I am game<br>
<br>
If you walk my way<br>
I could keep my head<br>
We could creep away<br>
In the dark<br>
Or maybe not<br>
We could shoot it down anyway<br>
<br>
I don't know if you read novels or the magazines<br>
If you love the hand that feeds you<br>
I assume that your heart's been bruised<br>
I'd like to know you<br>
<br>
You don't know if I can draw at all<br>
Or what records I am into<br>
If I sleep like a spoon or rarely at all<br>
Or maybe you would do<br>
Or maybe you would do<br>
<br>
If you walk my way<br>
I will keep my head<br>
We will feel our way<br>
Through the dark<br>
Though I don't know you I think that I would do<br>
I don't fall easy at all<br>
<br>
If you walk my way<br>
I will keep my head<br>
We will feel our way through the dark<br>
Though I don't know you I think that I would do<br>
I don't fall easy at all<br>
