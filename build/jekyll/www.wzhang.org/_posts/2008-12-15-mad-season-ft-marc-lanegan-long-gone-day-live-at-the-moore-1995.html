[Long Gone Day - Lyric]<br><br>
So much blood I'm starting to drown<br>
Runs from cold to colder<br>
Time to time the sky's come down<br>
To help me lose my way<br>
Tears and lies for answers<br>
You and open veins, God knows I'm gone<br>
Girl I just want you to<br>
Come on down<br>
Lord it's a storm and I'm heading to fall<br>
These sins are mine and I've done wrong, oh babe<br>
Come on down<br>
Long Gone Day<br>
Mmmm, who ever said<br>
We wash away with the rain<br>
<br>
See you all from time to time<br>
Isn't it so strange<br>
How far away we all are now<br>
Am I the only one who remembers that summer<br>
Oh, I remember<br>
Everyday each time the place was saved<br>
The music that we made<br>
The wind has carried all of that away<br>
<br>
Long gone day<br>
Mmmm, who ever said<br>
We wash away with the rain<br>
<br>
So many tears I'm starting to drown<br>
The rain in heaven's all come down<br>
Silver spoons affix the crown<br>
The luckless ones are broken<br>
Fears and lies for answers<br>
You and open flames<br>
God knows I'm gone<br>
And I just want you to<br>
Come on down, hmmm<br>
<br>
Lord it's a storm and I'm heading to fall<br>
These sins are mine and I've done wrong<br>
I want you to, oh, I just want you to<br>
Come on down<br>
<br>
I fear again, like then, I've lost my way<br>
And shout to God to bring my sunny day <br>
