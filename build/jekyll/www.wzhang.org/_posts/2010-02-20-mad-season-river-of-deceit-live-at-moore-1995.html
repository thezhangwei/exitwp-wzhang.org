<strong>[River of Deceit - Lyric]</strong><br>
My pain is self-chosen<br>
At least, so The Prophet says<br>
I could either burn<br>
Or cut off my pride and buy some time<br>
A head full of lies is the weight, tied to my waist<br>
<br>
The River of Deceit pulls down, oh oh<br>
The only direction we flow is down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
My pain is self-chosen<br>
At least I believe it to be<br>
I could either drown<br>
Or pull off my skin and swim to shore<br>
Now I can grow a beautiful shell for all to see<br>
<br>
The River of Deceit pulls down, yeah<br>
The only direction we flow is down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
Down, oh down<br>
<br>
The pain is self-chosen, yeah<br>
Our pain is self-chosen<br>
