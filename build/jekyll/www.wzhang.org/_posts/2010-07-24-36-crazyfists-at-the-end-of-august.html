<strong>[At The End of August - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>So I lit lanterns to light up all these words<br>
Looking back I know it's what I'd die for<br>
And through all this life<br>
Smashed away all the strife<br>
A friendship I paint<br>
Untouchable<br>
<br>
Crawling from the floor<br>
I been there before<br>
There I was staring back at the bottom<br>
And let's make this clear<br>
It came from these tears<br>
Carved across our chests<br>
Loyalty...<br>
<br>
And with the new light there was young hope<br>
To underline the meaning<br>
And carve our names in<br>
<br>
At the end of August<br>
The end of<br>
At the end of August<br>
The end of<br>
<br>
I'll never replace the ones I first made<br>
Jesus, does anyone?<br>
So I lit lanterns to <br>
Light up all these words<br>
Looking back I know it's what I'd die for<br>
And through all this life<br>
Smashed away all the strife<br>
A friendship I paint<br>
Untouchable<br>
<br>
And with the new light there was young hope<br>
To underline the meaning<br>
And carve our names in<br>
<br>
At the end of August<br>
The end of<br>
At the end of August<br>
The end of<br>
<br>
I'll never replace the ones I first made<br>
Jesus, does anyone?<br>
<br>
Crawling from the floor<br>
I been there before<br>
And let's make this clear<br>
Loyalty<br>
<br>
And I want you to know<br>
How all of you made me<br>
How all of you saved me<br>
And I'll never replace<br>
The ones I first made<br>
Jesus, does anyone?<br>
<br>
At the end of August<br>
The end of<br>
At the end of August<br>
The end of<br>
<br>
I'll never replace the ones I first made<br>
Jesus, does anyone?<br>
<br>
Crawling from the floor<br>
I been there before<br>
There I was staring back at the bottom<br>
<br>
And let's make this clear<br>
It came from these tears<br>
Carved across our chests<br>
Loyalty<br>
<br>
Loyalty, loyal<br>
