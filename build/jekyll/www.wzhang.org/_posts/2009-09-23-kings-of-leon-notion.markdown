[Notion - Lyric]
I got a notion to say what doesn't feel right
I got an answer in your story, today
It gave me a sign that didn't feel right, no 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 

I just wanted to know if I could go home 
Been rambling in day after day 
And everyone says I don't know 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 

Got a notion to say what doesn't feel right 
I just wanted to know if I could go home 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 

So don't knock it, don't knock it 
So don't knock it, don't knock it 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before 
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
