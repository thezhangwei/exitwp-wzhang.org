<p>Zooey Deschanel is accompanied by gay dancers while M. Ward cools off with his fake guitar solo... Isn't this adorable?!</p>

<strong>[In The Sun - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>It's hard to be ignored<br>
When I look at you, you look so bored<br>
My baby, my darling<br>
I've been taking a beating<br>
<br>
Well alright<br>
It's okay<br>
We all get to sleep sometimes everyday<br>
I'll just keep it to myself in the sun, in the sun<br>
It's hard to take the blame<br>
When I look at you, you're so ashamed<br>
My baby, my darling<br>
I've been thinking of leaving<br>
<br>
Well alright<br>
It's okay<br>
We all get to sleep sometimes everyday<br>
I'll just keep it to myself in the sun, in the sun</em>
