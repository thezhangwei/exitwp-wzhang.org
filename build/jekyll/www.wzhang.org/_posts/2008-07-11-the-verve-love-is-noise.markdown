Love is noise, Richard Ashcroft tells us in the Verve's newest single. Judging from the video, love also might have something to do with synchronized displays on vast sporting fields, helicopter shots of snow-covered peaks, and pyrotechnics in an alleyway behind two people making out.[From [Pitchfork](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/)]
