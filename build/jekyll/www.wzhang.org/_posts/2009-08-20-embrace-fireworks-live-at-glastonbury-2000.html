<strong>I Don't Need Convincing...</strong><br>
[Fireworks - Lyric]<br><br>
I stretched over to reach you<br>
I tried to meet you<br>
I've been wrong<br>
Now the fireworks in me are all gone<br>
It's time you realized<br>
<br>
My girl you make all the smart moves<br>
and you see through all my wrongs<br>
When the fireworks in me are all wrong<br>
Well then I realized<br>
<br>
And I dont need convincing <br>
I've seen enough to want to try and change things<br>
You fell in love I fell in line<br>
I thought I'd found my place<br>
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe<br>
Have I let you-I'll never let you down<br>
<br>
I work all day and I wanna fight<br>
when it feels right and it's wrong<br>
When the fireworks in me are all gone<br>
Well then I realized<br>
<br>
And I wont need convincing<br>
I've seen enough to want to try and change things<br>
You fell in love I fell in line<br>
I thought I'd found my place<br>
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe<br>
Could I leave you? I'll never let you down<br>
