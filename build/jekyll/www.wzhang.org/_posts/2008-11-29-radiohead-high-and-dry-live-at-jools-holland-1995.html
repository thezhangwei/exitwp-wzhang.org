[High and Dry - Lyric]<br><br>
Two jumps in a week<br>
I bet you think that's pretty clever<br>
Don't you boy<br>
Flying on your motorcycle<br>
Watching all the ground beneath you drop<br>
<br>
You'd kill yourself for recognition<br>
Kill yourself to never ever stop<br>
You broke another mirror<br>
You're turning into something you are not<br>
<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry<br>
Drying up in conversation<br>
You will be the one who cannot talk<br>
All your insides fall to pieces<br>
You just sit there<br>
Wishing you could still make love<br>
They're the ones who'll hate you<br>
When you think you've got the world<br>
All sussed out<br>
They're the ones who'll spit at you<br>
You will be the one screaming out<br>
<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry<br>
<br>
It's the best thing that you ever had<br>
The best thing that you ever, ever had<br>
It's the best thing that you ever had<br>
The best thing you have had, has gone away<br>
<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry<br>
<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me high<br>
Don't leave me dry <br>
