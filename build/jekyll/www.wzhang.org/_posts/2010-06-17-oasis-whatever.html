<strong>[Whatever - Lyric]</strong><br>
I'm free to be whatever I<br>
Whatever I choose <br>
And I'll sing the blues if I want <br>
<br>
I'm free to say whatever I<br>
Whatever I like<br>
If it's wrong or right it's alright <br>
<br>
Always seems to me<br>
You always see what people want you to see<br>
How long's it gonna be<br>
Before we get on the bus<br>
And cause no fuss<br>
Get a grip on yourself<br>
It dont cost much <br>
<br>
Free to be whatever you<br>
Whatever you say <br>
If it comes my way it's alright <br>
<br>
You're free to be wherever you<br>
Wherever you please<br>
You can shoot the breeze if you want <br>
<br>
It always seems to me<br>
You always see what people want you to see<br>
How long's it gonna be<br>
Before we get on the bus<br>
And cause no fuss<br>
Get a grip on yourself<br>
It don't cost much <br>
I'm free to be whatever I<br>
Whatever I choose<br>
And I'll sing the blues if I want <br>
<br>
Here in my mind<br>
You know you might find<br>
Something that you<br>
You thought you once knew<br>
But now it's all gone<br>
And you know it's no fun<br>
Yeah I know it's no fun<br>
Oh I know it's no fun <br>
<br>
I'm free to be whatever I<br>
Whatever I choose <br>
And I'll sing the blues if I want <br>
<br>
I'm free to be whatever I<br>
Whatever I choose <br>
And I'll sing the blues if I want<br>
<br>
Whatever you do<br>
Whatever you say<br>
Yeah I know it's alright <br>
<br>
Whatever you do<br>
Whatever you say<br>
Yeah I know it's alright<br>
