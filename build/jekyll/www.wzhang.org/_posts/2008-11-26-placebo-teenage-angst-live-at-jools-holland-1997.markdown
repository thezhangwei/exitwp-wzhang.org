[Teenage Angst - Lyric]
Shine the headlight,
straight into my eyes.
Like the roadkill,
I'm paralysed.
You see through my disguise

At the drive-in,
double feature,
pull the lever,
break the fever and say your last goodbyes.

Since I was born I started to decay.
Now nothing ever ever goes my way.

One fluid gesture,
like stepping back in time.
Trapped in amber, petrified.
And still not satisfied.

Airs and social graces,
elocution so divine.
I'll stick to my needle,
and my favourite waste of time,
both spineless and sublime.

Since I was born I started to decay.
Now nothing ever - ever goes my way.
