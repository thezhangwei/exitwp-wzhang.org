I'm talking about my parents for the moment.
[You're All That I Have - Lyric]
Strain this chaos turn it into light
I've got to see you one last night
Before the lions take their share
Leave us in pieces, scattered everywhere

Just give me a chance to hold on
Just give me a chance to hold on
Just give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear cause you are all that I have
It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear cause you are all that I have

You're cinematic, razor sharp
A welcome arrow through the heart
Under your skin feels like home
Electric shocks on aching bones

Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear cause you are all that I have
It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear cause you are all that I have

There is a darkness deep in you
A frightening magic I cling to

Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear now you are all that I have
It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear now you are all that I have
