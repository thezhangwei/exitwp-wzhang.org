[C'mon People (We're Making It Now) - Lyric]<br><br>
Sometimes I feel like I can't move on<br>
nothing in life is turning me on<br>
but I still see clearly, when I see you smiling<br>
<br>
you know nothing seems to fit<br>
I couldn't see my way through this shit<br>
when every single second of my waking day<br>
<br>
was thinking of you<br>
thinking of you<br>
you never know<br>
that I am alive<br>
I am alive<br>
I wanna grow<br>
there are so many things I can do<br>
just like falling in love with you<br>
<br>
so take my hand now understand now<br>
you can come here too<br>
<br>
c'mon people we're making it now<br>
yeah yeah yeah<br>
c'mon people we're making it now<br>
yeah yeah yeah<br>
<br>
but today I worked it out<br>
I got something I can shout about<br>
someone who believes in all the things I'm thinking<br>
<br>
but where have you gone<br>
where have you gone<br>
I'll never know<br>
<br>
that I am alive<br>
I am alive<br>
I wanna grow<br>
<br>
there are so many things I can do<br>
just like falling in love with you<br>
<br>
so take my hand now understand now<br>
you can come here too<br>
<br>
c'mon people we're making it now<br>
yeah yeah yeahhhh<br>
c'mon people we're making it now<br>
yeah yeah yeahhhh<br>
c'mon people we're making it now<br>
if only you could be with us<br>
<br>
I feel fine now<br>
I feel fine now<br>
don't stop now<br>
oh no no<br>
don't stop now<br>
oh no no<br>
