<strong>Macabre and Runic !!!</strong><br>

[Oblivion - Lyric]<br><br>
I flew beyond the sun before it was time<br>
Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell<br>
Waiting for you to pull me back in<br>
I almost had the world in my sight<br>
Lost love<br>
Bright eyes fading<br>
Faster than stars falling<br>
How can I tell you that I've failed<br>
Tell you I failed<br>
<br>
Falling from grace cause I've been away too long<br>
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song<br>
Now I'm lost in oblivion<br>
<br>
I tried to burrow a hole into the ground<br>
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hand<br>
The eyes of the child see no wrong<br>
Ignorant bliss impending doom<br>
<br>
Lost love<br>
Bright eyes fading<br>
Faster than stars falling<br>
How can I tell you that I've failed<br>
Tell you I failed<br>
<br>
Falling from grace cause I've been away too long<br>
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song<br>
Now I'm lost in oblivion<br>
<br>
[solo]<br>
<br>
Falling from grace cause I've been away too long<br>
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song<br>
Now I'm lost in oblivion<br>
