意大利冬天的天气很像中国南方，湿冷。不应该在这个季节去。
西班牙相对好一些，可惜只去了BCN。
去年十月计划这件事的时候做了一个表，回来后又整理了一下。应该比一大堆自己也分不出来背景是哪里的卡片机产物对别人有用。

一路上这首歌歌词印象比较深，其他还好。


[Thought I Knew - Lyric]
Sorry about my past life
Sorry but we just missed
Sorry it had to end up like this

Sorry if I caused you pain
Sorry I forgot your name
Sorry but you left me out in the rain

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew, but I didn’t have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true

Sorry if I caused you harm
Sorry I’m no good luck charm
Sorry you didn’t end up in my arms

Thought I knew you better than
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew, but I didn’t have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true

Now that I, world’s gone down
We’ve traded away, blew out the spark
And now we’re left with broken hearts
Tryin’ to find a new place to start

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew, but I didn’t have a clue
Not a single damn thing

I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew, but I didn’t have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true, was true
