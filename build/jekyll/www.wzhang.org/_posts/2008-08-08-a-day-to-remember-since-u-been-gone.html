[Since U Been Gone - Lyric]<br><br>
Here's the thing we started out friends<br>
It was cool but it was all pretend<br>
Yeah yeah<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
<br>
You dedicated you took the time<br>
Wasn't long till I called you mine<br>
Yeah Yeah<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
<br>
And all you'd ever hear me say<br>
Is how I pictured me with you<br>
That's all you'd ever hear me say<br>
<br>
But Since U Been Gone<br>
I can breathe for the first time<br>
I'm so moving on<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Thanks to you<br>
Now I get<br>
What I want<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
How can I put it? You put me on<br>
I even fell for that stupid love song<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
<br>
How come I'd never hear you say<br>
I just wanna be with you<br>
I guess you never felt that way<br>
<br>
But Since U Been Gone<br>
I can breathe for the first time<br>
I'm so moving on<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Thanks to you<br>
Now I get (I get) what I want<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
<br>
You had your chance you blew it<br>
Out of sight, out of mind<br>
Shut your mouth I just can't take it<br>
Again and again and again and again<br>
<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
I can breathe for the first time<br>
I'm so moving on<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Thanks to you (thanks to you)<br>
Now I get, I get what I want<br>
I can breathe for the first time<br>
I'm so moving on<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Thanks to you (thanks to you)<br>
Now I get (I get)<br>
You should know (you should know)<br>
That I get, I get what I want<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
Since U Been Gone<br>
