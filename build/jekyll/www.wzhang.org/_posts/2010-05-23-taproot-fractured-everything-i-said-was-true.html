<strong>[Fractured (Everything I said Was True) - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>Your story only tells one side, <br>
It's based on fact, but filled with lies <br>
(you'd be rich if each was worth a dime) <br>
I played my part and that's defined <br>
You played the field on borrowed time <br>
<br>
(and I know that fault was all but mine) <br>
<br>
I chose to let you in <br>
You chose to pull away <br>
I jumped right out of my skin <br>
When I heard you say <br>
<br>
Everything I said was true <br>
Everything except that I love you <br>
If anekatips it's not me, than who? <br>
I think I deserve to know <br>
Now we're through and through <br>
No glory resides inside my mind <br>
At least I never crossed the line <br>
(cause I don't need the distraction) <br>
But an angel appeared on your devil's side <br>
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide <br>
(I'm just a nickel with traction) <br>
<br>
So should we say goodnight <br>
And give it one more try? <br>
This isn't worth the fight <br>
So let's just say goodbye <br>
<br>
Everything I said was true <br>
Everything except I love you too <br>
and if it's not me, it's you! <br>
I thought you deserved to know <br>
now we're through and through <br>
<br>
Sad to see forethought after me cause <br>
that's not fair <br>
Put yourself in my shoes and become <br>
The fractured one cause <br>
I no longer care! <br>
<br>
Everything I said was true <br>
Everything except that I love you <br>
and if it's not me, fuck you! <br>
I thought you deserved to know <br>
Now I'm through with you <br>
<br>
And if it's not me, it's you! <br>
And if it's not me, it's you!</em>
