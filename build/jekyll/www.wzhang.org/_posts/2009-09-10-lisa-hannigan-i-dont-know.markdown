[I Don't Know - Lyric]
I don't know what you smoke
Or what countries you've been to
If you speak any other languages other than your own
I'd like to meet you

I don't know if you drive
If you love the ground beneath you
I don't know if you write letters or you panic on the phone
I'd like to call you

All the same, if you want to
I am game

I don't know if you can swim
If the sea has any draw for you
If you're better in the morning or when the sun goes down
I'd like to call you

I don't know if you can dance
If the thought ever occurred to you
If you eat what you've been given or you push it 'round your plate
I'd like to cook for you

All the same, I would want to
I am game

If you walk my way
I could keep my head
We could creep away
In the dark
Or maybe not
We could shoot it down anyway

I don't know if you read novels or the magazines
If you love the hand that feeds you
I assume that your heart's been bruised
I'd like to know you

You don't know if I can draw at all
Or what records I am into
If I sleep like a spoon or rarely at all
Or maybe you would do
Or maybe you would do

If you walk my way
I will keep my head
We will feel our way
Through the dark
Though I don't know you I think that I would do
I don't fall easy at all

If you walk my way
I will keep my head
We will feel our way through the dark
Though I don't know you I think that I would do
I don't fall easy at all
