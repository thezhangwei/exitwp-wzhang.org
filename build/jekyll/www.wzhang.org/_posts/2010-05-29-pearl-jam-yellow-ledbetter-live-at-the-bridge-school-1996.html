<p>"Yellow Ledbetter"早在1991年就录制了. 之后作为"Jeremy"的单曲B面发行. 没有官方的歌词. 从1993年第一次现场以来, 几乎每次Eddie Vedder都唱了不同的歌词. 我根据多个不同版本的现场歌词, handcode了这个版本. 不完善, 但大意有了.</p>

<strong>[Yellow Ledbetter - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>Unsealed <br>
On a wayside letter says<br>
I don't have to ever feel him again oh no<br>
On a front side on a wayside letter says <br>
I don't have to ever feel this way again oh no<br>
On a porch side I wish it all away yeah <br>
And I tried and I called and he said that I'll never gonna see you again no <br>
On a porch side on a front side letter said <br>
I don't I don't know whether it was the boxer or the bag <br>
Oh yeah hey...hey <br>
Can you see them <br>
Out on the porch yeah <br>
But they don't wave <br>
I see them <br>
Around the front way yeah heah <br>
And I know and I know I don't wanna stay<br>
Unsealed <br>
I Wanna wish it all away yeah <br>
Oh and I cry and I call and I can't get over this feeling again no <br>
On the porch side on the front side of the letter says <br>
I don't I don't know whether it was the boxer or the bag <br>
Oh yeah hey...hey <br>
Can you see them <br>
Out on the porch yeah <br>
But they don't wave <br>
But I see them <br>
Round the front way yeah yeah yeah <br>
And I know and I know I don't wanna stay at all <br>
I don't wanna stay 3x <br>
No no no <br>
Oh ho oh oh oh...oh ho oh oh oh oh oh</em>
