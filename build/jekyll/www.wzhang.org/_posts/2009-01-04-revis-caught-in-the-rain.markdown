[Caught In The Rain - Lyric]

Is it real
We're always the same
We're almost undone now
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground
Awaiting the call
Of what would you say
And can you come over
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Chorus:
It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You're telling me something real
Well, what we've done
It doesn't matter now
Whatever it takes
For you to stay with me

Trading thoughts
Across from the room
I saw you surrounded
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground
Feeling us fall
Without an escape
I almost let you down
I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Chorus (x2)

I was caught in the rain,
Wasting my time on the ground (x2)

I was caught in the rain
Caught in the rain"
