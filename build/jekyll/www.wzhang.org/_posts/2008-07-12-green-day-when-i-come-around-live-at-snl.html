<p>Green Day, They're still kicking asses but who else...?</p>
<b>[When I come around - lyric - Click More]</b><br>
<em>I heard you crying loud,<br>
all the way across town<br>
You've been searching for that someone,<br>
and it's me out on the prowl<br>
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself<br>
Well, don't get lonely now<br>
And dry your whining eyes<br>
I'm just roaming for the moment<br>
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight<br>
you been thinking about ditching me<br>
<br>
No time to search the world around<br>
Cause you know where I'll be found<br>
When I come around<br>
I heard it all before<br>
So don't knock down my door<br>
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser<br>
to try and slag me down because I know you're right<br>
So go do what you like<br>
Make sure you do it wise<br>
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing<br>
was ever there<br>
<br>
You can't go forcing something if it's just<br>
not right<br>
<br>
No time to search the world around<br>
Cause you know where I'll be found<br>
When I come around<br>
When I come around<br>
<br>
No time to search the world around<br>
Cause you know where I'll be found<br>
When I come around<br>
When I come around<br>
When I come around<br>
When I come around</em>
