[I'm Amazed - Lyric]
I'm amazed in the quiet ocean
I'm amazed at your wrong devotion
I'm amazed at what the people saying
I'm amazed by a divided nation
Like the middle of the earth
I get disrupted
I'm amazed at all that has been
I'm amazed at all who be
I'm amazed at the tv stations
I'm amazed what they want me to believe
After all is said and done
Now lets seek justice

I'm amazed at the evolution
I'm amazed at the lack of faith
I'm amazed at love we are rejected
I'm amazed that we accepted this place
Like the middle of the earth and the middle of the ages
Like a river I get disrupted
