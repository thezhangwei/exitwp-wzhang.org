[Broken - Lyric]<br><br>
I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh<br>
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away<br>
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well<br>
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain<br>
<br>
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome<br>
And I don't feel right when you're gone away<br>
You've gone away<br>
You don't feel me here anymore<br>
The worst is over now and we can breathe again<br>
I wanna hold you high and you steal my pain away<br>
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight<br>
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain<br>
<br>
Cause I'm broken when I'm open<br>
And I don't feel like I am strong enough<br>
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome<br>
And I don't feel right when you're gone away<br>
<br>
Cause I'm broken when I'm open<br>
And I don't feel like I am strong enough<br>
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome<br>
And I don't feel right when you're gone away<br>
<br>
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome<br>
And I don't feel right when you're gone<br>
You've gone away<br>
You don't feel me here anymore. <br>
