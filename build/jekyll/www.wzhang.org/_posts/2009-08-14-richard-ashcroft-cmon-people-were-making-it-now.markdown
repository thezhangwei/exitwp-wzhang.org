[C'mon People (We're Making It Now) - Lyric]
Sometimes I feel like I can't move on
nothing in life is turning me on
but I still see clearly, when I see you smiling

you know nothing seems to fit
I couldn't see my way through this shit
when every single second of my waking day

was thinking of you
thinking of you
you never know

that I am alive
I am alive
I wanna grow
there are so many things I can do
just like falling in love with you

so take my hand now understand now
you can come here too

c'mon people we're making it now
yeah yeah yeah
c'mon people we're making it now
yeah yeah yeah

but today I worked it out
I got something I can shout about
someone who believes in all the things I'm thinking

but where have you gone
where have you gone
I'll never know

that I am alive
I am alive
I wanna grow

there are so many things I can do
just like falling in love with you

so take my hand now understand now
you can come here too

c'mon people we're making it now
yeah yeah yeahhhh
c'mon people we're making it now
yeah yeah yeahhhh
c'mon people we're making it now
if only you could be with us

I feel fine now
I feel fine now
don't stop now
oh no no
don't stop now
oh no no
