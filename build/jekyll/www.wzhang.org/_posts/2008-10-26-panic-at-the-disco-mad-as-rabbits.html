[Mad as Rabbits - Lyric]<br><br>
Come save me from walking off a windowsill<br>
Or I’ll sleep in the rain<br>
Don’t you remember when I was a bird<br>
And you were a map?<br>
<br>
Now he drags down miles in America<br>
Briefcase in hand<br>
The stove is creeping up his spine again<br>
Can’t get enough trash<br>
<br>
He took the days for pageant<br>
Became as mad as rabbits<br>
With bushels of bad habits<br>
Who could ask for anymore?<br>
Yea who could have more<br>
His arms were the branches of a Christmas tree<br>
Preached the devil in the belfry<br>
He checked in<br>
To learn his clothes had been thieved at the train station<br>
<br>
A rope hung his other branch<br>
and at the end was a dog called Bambi<br>
Who was chewing on his Parliaments<br>
When he tried to save the calendar business<br>
He tried to save the calendar business<br>
<br>
He took the days for pageant<br>
Became as mad as rabbits<br>
With bushels of bad habits<br>
Who could ask for anymore?<br>
Yea who could have more<br>
<br>
The poor son of a humble chimney sweep<br>
Fell to a cheap crowd<br>
So stay asleep and put on that cursive type<br>
You know we live in a toy<br>
<br>
You know that Paul Cates bought himself a trumpet from the Salvation Army<br>
But there ain’t no sunshine in his song<br>
We must reinvent love, reinvent love, reinvent love<br>
<br>
He took the days for pageant<br>
Became as mad as rabbits<br>
With bushels of bad habits<br>
Who could ask for anymore?<br>
Yea who could have more<br>
<br>
We must reinvent love, reinvent love, reinvent love <br>
