"Yellow Ledbetter"早在1991年就录制了. 之后作为"Jeremy"的单曲B面发行. 没有官方的歌词. 从1993年第一次现场以来, 几乎每次Eddie Vedder都唱了不同的歌词. 我根据多个不同版本的现场歌词, handcode了这个版本. 不完善, 但大意有了.

**[Yellow Ledbetter - Lyric]**
_Unsealed 
On a wayside letter says
I don't have to ever feel him again oh no
On a front side on a wayside letter says 
I don't have to ever feel this way again oh no
On a porch side I wish it all away yeah 
And I tried and I called and he said that I'll never gonna see you again no 
On a porch side on a front side letter said 
I don't I don't know whether it was the boxer or the bag 
Oh yeah hey...hey 
Can you see them 
Out on the porch yeah 
But they don't wave 
I see them 
Around the front way yeah heah 
And I know and I know I don't wanna stay

Unsealed 
I Wanna wish it all away yeah 
Oh and I cry and I call and I can't get over this feeling again no 
On the porch side on the front side of the letter says 
I don't I don't know whether it was the boxer or the bag 
Oh yeah hey...hey 
Can you see them 
Out on the porch yeah 
But they don't wave 
But I see them 
Round the front way yeah yeah yeah 
And I know and I know I don't wanna stay at all 
I don't wanna stay 3x 
No no no 
Oh ho oh oh oh...oh ho oh oh oh oh oh_
