<p>In Irvine. I will find some time to keep the site more updated.</p>
<strong>[Laredo - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>Gonna take a trip to Laredo<br>
Gonna take a dip in the lake<br>
Oh, I'm at a crossroads with myself<br>
I don't got no one else<br>
<br>
And possibilities at the door<br>
I won't be needing them anymore<br>
Oh, is this the first time in your life?<br>
It's hard just to get by<br>
<br>
But oh, my love, don't you even know?<br>
And oh, my love, are you really gone?<br>
Ooooh<br>
And can you see the world through a window?<br>
Are you having troubles in droves?<br>
Oh, I think the worst thing I could do<br>
Is get back home to you<br>
<br>
I put a bullet in my Kia Lorenzo<br>
A kitchen knife fucked in my face<br>
Throw me in the deep of Jenner Lake<br>
Believe me when I say<br>
<br>
That oh, my love, you don't even call<br>
And oh, my love, is that you on the phone?<br>
Ooooh<br>
<br>
And oh, my love, you don't even know<br>
That oh, my love, are you really gone?<br>
Ooooh<br>
