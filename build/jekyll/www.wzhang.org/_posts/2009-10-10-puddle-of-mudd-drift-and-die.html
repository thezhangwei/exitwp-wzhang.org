[Drift and Die - Lyric]<br><br>
Forgotten thoughts of yesterdays<br>
Through my eyes, I see the past<br>
Well I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why<br>
<br>
I believe, I believe, I believe in the truth<br>
From inside<br>
Go away, go away, go away from me<br>
Leave me alone<br>
<br>
Ignorance spreads lies<br>
How much will money buy<br>
Well I'll take my time<br>
As I drift and die<br>
Unwanted, live my life in shame<br>
Who's to blame for my mistakes<br>
Well I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why<br>
<br>
I believe I said I believe in the truth<br>
From inside<br>
Go away, go away, go away from me<br>
Leave me alone<br>
<br>
Ignorance spreads lies<br>
How much will money buy<br>
Well I'll take my time<br>
As I drift and die<br>
As I drift and die<br>
As I drift and die<br>
As I drift and die<br>
<br>
Ignorance spreads lies<br>
How much will money buy<br>
Well I'll take my time<br>
As I drift and die<br>
