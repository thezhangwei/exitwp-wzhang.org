[Lyric - Shame in You]
When I awaken. And I'm achin'. 'Time for sleepin', yeah.
When I'm sayin'.   Time to go and.   I've been hurtin', yeah.
When I'm layin'.   I'm still trying.   Concentrating on dyin', yeah.

You're right as rain.   But you're wrong to blame. Agreed my crime's the same.
My sins I'll claim.   Give you back shed pain. Go find a place for own shame.
So you can deal.   With this thing unreal. No one made you feel any hurt, yeah.

Body's movin'.   Only provin'. No one needed to move.
Still believin'.  Yet mistaken.  All God's children, yeah.

And I must say. I was stupid. Selfishly she consumed, yeah.
And you must change. Patterns all we trained. Or n'er regain peace you seek.
Now you hear me. For the things I see. Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah

Throw out. Blow up. Hold in.
Show fine. No signs. Grow blind.

**没想到Q4考试都算顺利,可能是因为时间跨度比较长.
Q3/Q4几乎都完成了三门课,确实不轻松.
WK24 Summer course开始前, 下周可以有机会出门轻松一下.
同学大都启程回国了,但是这个季节的瑞典确实很漂亮....**
