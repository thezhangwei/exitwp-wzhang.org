[The Pot - Lyric]<br><br>
Who are you to wave your finger?<br>
You must have been out your head<br>
Eye hole deep in muddy waters<br>
You practically raised the dead<br>
<br>
Rob the grave to snow the cradle<br>
Then burn the evidence down<br>
Soapbox house of cards and glass so<br>
Don't go tossin' your stones around<br>
<br>
You must have been high<br>
You must have been high<br>
You must have been<br>
Foot in mouth and head up ass<br>
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?<br>
Difficult to dance 'round this one<br>
Till you pull it out, boy<br>
<br>
You must have been so high<br>
You must have been so high<br>
<br>
Steal, borrow, refer<br>
Save your shady inference<br>
Kangaroo done hung the jury<br>
With the innocent<br>
<br>
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo<br>
Got lemon juice up in your eye, oh<br>
When you pissed all over my black kettle<br>
<br>
You must have been high, high<br>
You must have been high, high<br>
<br>
Who are you to wave your finger?<br>
So full of it<br>
Eye balls deep in muddy waters<br>
Fuckin' hypocrite<br>
<br>
Liar, lawyer; mirror show me<br>
What's the difference?<br>
Kangaroo done hung the guilty<br>
With the innocent<br>
<br>
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo<br>
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye<br>
When you pissed all over my black kettle<br>
You must've been<br>
<br>
So who are you to wave your finger?<br>
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?<br>
You must have been out your mind<br>
<br>
Weepin' shades of indigo<br>
Shed without a reason<br>
Weepin' shades of indigo<br>
<br>
Liar, lawyer; mirror for you<br>
What's the difference?<br>
Kangaroo be stoned<br>
He's guilty as the government<br>
<br>
Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo<br>
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye<br>
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle<br>
<br>
You must've been<br>
High<br>
High<br>
High<br>
High<br>
<br>
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters<br>
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters<br>
Ganja? Please<br>
You must have been out your mind <br>
