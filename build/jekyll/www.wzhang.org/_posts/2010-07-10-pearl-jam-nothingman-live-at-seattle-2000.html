<strong>[Nothingman - Lyric]</strong><br>
<em>Once divided...nothing left to subtract...<br>
Some words when spoken...can't be taken back...<br>
Walks on his own...with thoughts he can't help thinking...<br>
Future's above...but in the past he's slow and sinking...<br>
Caught a bolt 'a li<strong>G</strong>htnin'...cu<strong>R</strong>sed the day he let it go...<br>
<br>
Nothingman... (2x)<br>
Isn't it something?<br>
Nothingman...<br>
She once believed...in every story he had to tell...<br>
One day she stiffened...took the other side...<br>
Empty stares...from each corner of a shared prison cell...<br>
One just escapes...one's left inside the well...<br>
And he who forgets...will be destined to remember...oh...oh...oh...<br>
<br>
Nothingman... (2x)<br>
Isn't it something?<br>
Nothingman...<br>
<br>
Oh, she don't want him...<br>
Oh, she won't feed him...after he's flown away...<br>
Oh, into the sun...ah, into the sun...<br>
<br>
Burn...burn...<br>
Nothingman... (2x)<br>
Isn't it something?<br>
Nothingman...<br>
Nothingman... (2x)<br>
Coulda' been something...<br>
Nothingman...<br>
Oh...ohh...ohh... </em>
