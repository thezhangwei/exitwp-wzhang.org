<strong>[Dollar Bill - Lyric]</strong><br>
<br>
Torn like an old dollar bill<br>
Girl let them say what they will<br>
That no one should hurt you<br>
And that's all I seem to do<br>
That no one should desert you<br>
And that's all I seem to do<br>
<br>
I got to tell you, goodbye mama<br>
We've taken this too far<br>
Been trying to tell you what's going on<br>
Trying to make it easy on you<br>
Trying to make it better<br>
Make it easier on you<br>
It's all I came to do<br>
It's all I came to do<br>
Now I'm down in the light<br>
And I must be dreaming it<br>
Cause I see clearly, I see angels here<br>
Bringing something to me, Mother Mercy<br>
<br>
I told a lie, I didn't mean it<br>
Goodbye mama, I've taken this too far<br>
Been gone a while<br>
Been gone a long way, oh yeah<br>
<br>
I don't want to hurt you<br>
It's all I seem to do<br>
Don't want to desert you<br>
It's all I seem to do<br>
<br>
I got to tell you, goodbye mama<br>
I've taken this too far<br>
Been down a while<br>
Been down a long way<br>
<br>
Trying to make it easy on you<br>
Trying to make it better<br>
Make it easier on you<br>
It's all I came to do<br>
It's all I came to do<br>
It's all I came to do<br>
That's all... been down a long<br>
Been down a long, long way<br>
Torn like an old dollar bill <br>
