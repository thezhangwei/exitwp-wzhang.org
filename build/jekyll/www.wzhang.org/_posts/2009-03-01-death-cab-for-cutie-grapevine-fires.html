[Grapevine Fire - Lyric]<br><br>
When the wind picked up, the fire spread<br>
And the grapevine seemed left for dead<br>
And the northern sky looked like the end of days<br>
The end of days<br>
<br>
The wake-up call to a rented room<br>
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom<br>
To warn us it's only a matter of time<br>
Before we all burn<br>
Before we all burn<br>
Before we all burn<br>
Before we all burn<br>
We bought some wine and some paper cups<br>
Near your daughter's school when we picked her up<br>
And drove to a cemetery on a hill<br>
On a hill<br>
<br>
And we watched the plumes paint the sky gray<br>
As she laughed and danced through the field of graves<br>
There I knew it would be alright<br>
That everything would be alright<br>
Would be alright<br>
Would be alright<br>
Would be alright<br>
<br>
And the news reports on the radio said it was getting worse<br>
As the ocean air fanned the flames<br>
But I couldn't think of anywhere I would've rather been<br>
To watch it all burn away, to burn away<br>
<br>
Burn<br>
Burn<br>
Burn<br>
<br>
The firemen worked in double shifts<br>
With prayers for rain on their lips<br>
And they knew it was only a matter of time <br>
