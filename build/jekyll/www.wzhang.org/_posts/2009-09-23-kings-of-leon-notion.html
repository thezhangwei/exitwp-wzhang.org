[Notion - Lyric]<br><br>
I got a notion to say what doesn't feel right<br>
I got an answer in your story, today<br>
It gave me a sign that didn't feel right, no <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
<br>
I just wanted to know if I could go home <br>
Been rambling in day after day <br>
And everyone says I don't know <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
<br>
Got a notion to say what doesn't feel right <br>

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
<br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before <br>
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before<br>
