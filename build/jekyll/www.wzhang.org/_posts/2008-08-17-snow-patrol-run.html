<p>这支苏格兰乐队04年的这首又臭又长的歌现在特别能打动俺。</p>

[Run - Lyric]<br><br>
I'll sing it one last time for you<br>
Then we really have to go<br>
You've been the only thing that's right<br>
In all I've done<br>
<br>
And I can barely look at you<br>
But every single time I do<br>
I know we'll make it anywhere<br>
Away from here<br>
<br>
Light up, Light up<br>
As if you have a choice<br>
Even if you cannot hear my voice<br>
I'll be right beside you dear<br>
<br>
Louder, louder<br>
And we'll run for our lives<br>
I can hardly speak I understand<br>
Why you can't raise your voice to say<br>
To think I might not see those eyes<br>
It makes it so hard not to cry<br>
And as we say our long goodbyes<br>
I nearly do<br>
<br>
Light up, light up<br>
As if you have a choice<br>
Even if you cannot hear my voice<br>
I'll be right beside you dear<br>
<br>
Louder, louder<br>
And we'll run for our lives<br>
I can hardly speak I understand<br>
Why you can't raise your voice to say<br>
<br>
Slower, slower<br>
We don't have time for that<br>
All I want is to find an easier way<br>
To get out of our little heads<br>
<br>
Have heart my dear<br>
We're bound to be afraid<br>
Even if it's just for a few days<br>
Making up for all this mess<br>
<br>
Light up, light up<br>
As if you have a choice<br>
Even if you cannot hear my voice<br>
I'll be right beside you dear				<br>
