[Knocked Up - Lyric]<br><br>
I don't care what nobody says we're gonna have a baby<br>
Takin' off in a Coupe de Ville she's buckled up on navy<br>
<br>
She don't care what her momma says no she's gonna have my baby<br>
I'm taking all I have to take because taken gonna shape me<br>
<br>
People call us renegades because we like living crazy<br>
We like taking on the town because people are getting lazy<br>
<br>
I don't care what nobody says no I'm gonna be her lover<br>
Always mad and usually drunk, but I love her like no other<br>
<br>
And the doctor seems to say he don't know where we're gonna go<br>
<br>
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know where we're gonna go<br>
People call us renegades because we like living crazy<br>
We like takin' on this town because people are getting lazy<br>
<br>
I don't care what nobody says no I'm going to be her lover<br>
Always mad and usually drunk but I love her like no other<br>
<br>
And her daddy doesn't think he quite knows where we're gonna go<br>
<br>
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know where we're gonna go...<br>
<br>
Where we're gonna go...<br>
<br>
Where we're gonna go...<br>
<br>
Where we're gonna go...<br>
<br>
Where we're gonna...<br>
<br>
<br>
People call us renegades...<br>
<br>
We like taking on this town...<br>
<br>
I don't care what nobody says we're gonna have a baby<br>
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville she's buckled up on navy<br>
<br>
<br>
She don't care what her momma says no she's gonna have my baby<br>
I'm takin' all I have to take because taken gonna shape me <br>
