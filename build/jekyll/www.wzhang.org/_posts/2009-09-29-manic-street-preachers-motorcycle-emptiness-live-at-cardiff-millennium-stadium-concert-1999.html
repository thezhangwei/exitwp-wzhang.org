[Motorcycle Emptiness - Lyric]<br><br>
Culture sucks down words<br>
Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles<br>
Organise your safe tribal war<br>
Hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto<br>
<br>
Each day living out a lie<br>
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever<br>
<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Life lies a slow suicide<br>
Orthodox dreams and symbolic myths<br>
From feudal serf to spender<br>
This wonderful world of purchase power<br>
<br>
Just like lungs sucking on air<br>
Survival's natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow<br>
<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
<br>
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br>
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br>
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br>
All we want from you are the kicks you've given us<br>
<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
<br>
Drive away and it's the same<br>
Everywhere death row, everyone's a victim<br>
Your joys are counterfeit<br>
This happiness corrupt political shit<br>
<br>
Living life like a comatose<br>
Ego loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow<br>
<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness<br>
Under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness<br>
