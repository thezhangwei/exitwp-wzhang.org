[Made of Scars - Lyric]<br><br>
This one came from looking, this one opened twice<br>
These two seemed as smooth as silk, flush against my eyes<br>
This one needed stitches and this one came from rings<br>
This one isn't even there, but I feel it more because you don't care<br>
<br>
Yeah, cut right into me<br>
Yeah, because I am made of scars<br>
Yes, I am made of scars<br>
<br>
This one had it coming, this one found a vein<br>
This one was an accident, but never gave me pain<br>
This one was my father's and this one you can't see<br>
This one had me scared to death, but I guess I should be glad I'm not dead<br>
<br>
Yeah, cut right into me<br>
Yeah, because I am made of scars<br>
Yes, I am made of scars<br>
Yeah<br>
God, don't you believe the hype?<br>
God, don't you believe the hype?<br>
God, don't you believe the hype?<br>
Ohhh, don't believe the hype!<br>
<br>
Oh yeah<br>
Oh yeah<br>
<br>
And I will find a way<br>
Everything you are I will betray<br>
Oh, I swear that I will find a way<br>
Everything you are's inside me<br>
<br>
This one was the first one, this one had a vice<br>
This one here I like to rub on dark and stormy nights<br>
This one was the last one, I don't remember how<br>
But I remember blood and rain and I never saw it coming again<br>
<br>
Yeah, cut right into me<br>
Yeah, because I am made of scars<br>
Yes, I am made of scars<br>
Yes, I am made of scars<br>
Yes, I am made of scars<br>
Thats what I'm made of <br>
