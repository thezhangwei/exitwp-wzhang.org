Zooey Deschanel is accompanied by gay dancers while M. Ward cools off with his fake guitar solo... Isn't this adorable?!

**[In The Sun - Lyric]**
_It's hard to be ignored
When I look at you, you look so bored
My baby, my darling
I've been taking a beating

Well alright
It's okay
We all get to sleep sometimes everyday
I'll just keep it to myself in the sun, in the sun

It's hard to take the blame
When I look at you, you're so ashamed
My baby, my darling
I've been thinking of leaving

Well alright
It's okay
We all get to sleep sometimes everyday
I'll just keep it to myself in the sun, in the sun_
