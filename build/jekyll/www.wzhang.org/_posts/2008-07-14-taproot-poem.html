[Poem - Lyric]<br><br>
overbearing panic attack entrenching my veins<br>
in an hour i'll be ok<br>
i pray this pain will go away permanently someday<br>
I'VE seen more than...<br>
I should have to...<br>
I'VE seen this on my own<br>
<br>
this song is a,<br>
poem to myself,<br>
it helps me to live...<br>
in case of fire,<br>
BREAK the glass,<br>
and move on into your own...<br>
reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my brain,<br>
i hope you'll be ok someday,<br>
so i can say that you moved on in the right way...<br>
WE'VE seen this and<br>
WE'VE breathed this and<br>
WE'VE lived this on our own...<br>
<br>
this song is a,<br>
poem to myself,<br>
it helps me to live...<br>
in case of fire,<br>
BREAK the glass,<br>
and move on into your own...<br>
your own...<br>
<br>
BREAK...<br>
<br>
this song is a,<br>
poem to myself,<br>
it helps me to live...<br>
in case of fire,<br>
BREAK the glass,<br>
and move on into your own...<br>
