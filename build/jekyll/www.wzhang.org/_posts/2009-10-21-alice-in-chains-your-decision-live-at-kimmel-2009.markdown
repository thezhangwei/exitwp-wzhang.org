[Your decision - Lyric]
Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your God

It's your decision
It's your decision

Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned

It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside

No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over

(solo)

It might seem an afterthought
Yes it hurts to know you're bought

It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside

It's your decision
It's your decision

No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over

It's over
