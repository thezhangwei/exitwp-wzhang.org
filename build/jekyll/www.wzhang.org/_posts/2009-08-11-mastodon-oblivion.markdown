**Macabre and Runic !!!**

[Oblivion - Lyric]
I flew beyond the sun before it was time
Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell
Waiting for you to pull me back in
I almost had the world in my sight

Lost love
Bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed
Tell you I failed

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

I tried to burrow a hole into the ground
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hand
The eyes of the child see no wrong
Ignorant bliss impending doom

Lost love
Bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed
Tell you I failed

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion

[solo]

Falling from grace cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion
