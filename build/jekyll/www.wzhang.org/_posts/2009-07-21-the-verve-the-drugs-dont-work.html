[The Drugs Don't Work - Lyric]<br><br>
All this talk of getting old<br>
It's getting me down my love<br>
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown<br>
This time I'm coming down<br>
And I hope you're thinking of me<br>
As you lay down on your side<br>
Now the drugs don't work<br>
They just make you worse<br>
But I know I'll see your face again<br>
<br>
Now the drugs don't work<br>
They just make you worse<br>
But I know I'll see your face again<br>
<br>
But I know I'm on a losing streak<br>
As I pass down my old street<br>
And if you wanna show, then just let me know<br>
And I'll sing in your ear again<br>
<br>
Now the drugs don't work<br>
They just make you worse<br>
But I know I'll see your face again<br>
<br>
'Cause baby, ooh, if heaven calls, I'm coming too<br>
Just like you said, you leave my life, I'm better off dead<br>
<br>
All this talk of getting old<br>
It's getting me down my Lord<br>
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown<br>
This time I'm coming down<br>
<br>
Now the drugs don't work<br>
They just make you worse<br>
But I know I'll see your face again<br>
<br>
'Cause baby, ooh, if heaven calls, I'm coming too<br>
Just like you said, you leave my life, I'm better off dead<br>
<br>
But if you wanna show, just let me know<br>
And I'll sing in your ear again<br>
<br>
Now the drugs don't work<br>
They just make you worse<br>
But I know I'll see your face again<br>
<br>
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again<br>
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again<br>
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord<br>
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord<br>
<br>
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down<br>
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more<br>
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down<br>
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more<br>
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down<br>
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more<br>
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down<br>
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more<br>
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down<br>
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more<br>
