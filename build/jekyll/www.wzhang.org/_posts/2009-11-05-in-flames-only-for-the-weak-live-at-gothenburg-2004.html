[Only For The Weak - Lyric]<br><br>
I can't tolerate your sadness<br>
Cause it's me you are drowning (You're drowning me)<br>
I won't allow (allow) any happiness<br>
Cause everytime you laugh, I feel so (so weak)... guilty (guilty)<br>
I feel so guilty<br>
<br>
Am I forced to have any regret<br>
I've become the lie, beautiful and free<br>
In my righteous own mind<br>
I adore and preach the insanity you gave to me<br>
<br>
Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me<br>
I've lost the ability to paint the clouds<br>
Cause it's me you're draining (You're draining me)<br>
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark tale<br>
Cause everytime you run, I fall (fall).. behind (behind)<br>
I fall behind<br>
<br>
And so I hear my voice again<br>
The tale of the bitter man there I am<br>
Shake the silence and hear what it says<br>
The tranquil pride that become the lie<br>
<br>
Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me<br>
<br>
Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
On bleeding knees, oh, I accept my fate<br>
<br>
[instrumental part]<br>
<br>
Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me<br>
<br>
Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
On bleeding knees, oh, I accept my fate<br>
<br>
Sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
No need for a sympathy, the misery that is me<br>
<br>
Oh, sell me the infection, it is only for the weak<br>
On bleeding knees...<br>
