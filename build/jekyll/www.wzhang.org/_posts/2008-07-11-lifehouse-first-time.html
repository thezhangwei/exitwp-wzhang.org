[First Time - Lyric - Click More]<br><br>
We're both looking for something<br>
We've been afraid to find<br>
It's easier to be broken<br>
It's easier to hide<br>
Looking at you,holding my breath,<br>
For once in my life,I'm scared to death,<br>
I'm taking a chance,letting you inside.<br>
<br>
Feeling alive all over again,<br>
As deep as the sky, under my skin<br>
Like being in love, she says<br>
For the first time<br>
Maybe I'm wrong,<br>
But I'm feeling right where I belong<br>
With you tonight<br>
Like being in love<br>
To feel for the first time<br>
<br>
The world that I see inside you<br>
Waiting to come to life<br>
Waking me up to dreaming<br>
Reality in your eyes<br>
<br>
Looking at you,<br>
Holding my breath,<br>
For once in my life<br>
I'm scared to death,<br>
I'm taking a chance,<br>
Letting you inside.<br>
<br>
I'm feeling alive all over again<br>
As deep as the sky that's under my skin<br>
Like being in love, she says, for the first time<br>
Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right<br>
Where I belong with you tonight<br>
Like being in love to feel for the first time<br>
<br>
We're crashing<br>
Into the unknown<br>
We're lost in this<br>
But it feels like home<br>
<br>
I'm feeling alive all over again<br>
As deep as the sky that's under my skin<br>
Like being in love, she says, for the first time<br>
Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right<br>
Where I belong with you tonight<br>
Like being in love to feel for the first time<br>
